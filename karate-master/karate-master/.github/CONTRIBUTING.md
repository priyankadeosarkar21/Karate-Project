# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project !

* Before submitting a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR), please make sure that you have had a discussion with the project-leads
* If a [relevant issue](https://github.com/intuit/karate/issues) already exists, have a discussion within that issue (by commenting) - and make sure that the project-leads are okay with your approach
* If no relevant issue exists, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/intuit/karate/issues) to start a discussion
* Please proceed with a PR only *after* the project admins or owners are okay with your approach. We don't want you to spend time and effort working on something - only to find out later that it was not aligned with how the project developers were thinking about it !
* You can refer to the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/intuit/karate/wiki/Developer-Guide) for information on how to build and test the project on your local / developer machine
* **IMPORTANT**: Submit your PR(s) against the [`develop`](https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/develop) branch of this repository

If you are interested in project road-map items that you can potentially contribute to, please refer to the [Project Board](https://github.com/intuit/karate/projects/3).
